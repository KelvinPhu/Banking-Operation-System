The Banking Operations System is a comprehensive software solution built using Java Spring Boot for the backend and Angular JavaScript for the frontend. It is designed to streamline and automate various banking processes, offering efficient account management, seamless transaction processing, robust security measures, and comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities. With multi-channel access and integration with third-party services, it aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

### Register / Login Customer

- Enable customers to deposit funds into their accounts through a secure and user-friendly interface.
- Implement validation checks to ensure the accuracy and integrity of deposited funds.

### Withdraw
- Allow customers to withdraw funds from their accounts conveniently, adhering to banking regulations and withdrawal limits.
- Implement transaction logging to track withdrawal activities and ensure transparency.


### Fund Transfer
- Facilitate fund transfers between accounts, both within the same bank and to external accounts.
- Implement secure transfer protocols and validation checks to prevent fraud and errors.


### Account PIN
- Allow customers to set and update their account PIN for additional security.
- Implement encryption and hashing techniques to protect sensitive user information.

### User Profile
- Provide customers with the ability to view and update their user profiles, including personal information and contact details.
- Implement validation checks to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

### Transaction History
- Maintain a comprehensive transaction history for each customer account, including deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and other activities.
- Enable customers to view their transaction history for auditing and reconciliation purposes.
